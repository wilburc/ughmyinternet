        <h1>ugh, my internet.</h1>
        <p>
          The summer of 2015 saw graduation and/or new jobs for some of us. This change meant we were all moving away from the sterile suburbs of Irvine for yellower pastures—and given that none of us made any new friends, the resulting group chat is all we had, really.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me in particular, the summer also brought the cruel wrath of the internet gods, rendering me helpless for 46 days and 45 nights, watering the lifeless router with my tears. Thus, the group chat “ugh my internet” was born. While the moniker has long been changed to something infinitely better and funnier, “ugh my internet” remains a classic reference to that dreadful summer, and ultimately to the millennial’s eternal struggle in dealing with the internet and all it has to offer. Also, I thought the URL <a href="">ughmyinter.net</a> was genius and happened to have $12 in <a href='http://google.com/domains'>Google Domains</a> credits. 
        </p>
        <p>
          To no one’s surprise, Facebook keeps pretty much all of your information—including every conversation you’ve ever had. To <i>some</i> people’s surprise, it’s actually <a href='https://www.facebook.com/dyi?x=Adlpa-5IQm3z4Fey'>available for you to download</a>. Combining my obsession with making meaningless things out of meaningful data, and a genuine curiosity in how “lit” the group chat was, I knew exactly what this beautiful URL was destined for.

          Starting from that fateful July day, the group chat has represented every aspect of our lives—our petty complaints, our angry rants, and the occasional tirade.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there were simpler times, back when we were all just enjoying each other’s virtual presence. Everyone was equally active, having things going on and real conversations. “ugh my internet” has grown so much since then. It’s become an incredibly meta cesspool of nonsense. Where did it all go wrong?

          The line chart summarizes our story: three friends begin on this adventure, happily talking about their post-college lives. “wilb” complaining about the hour-long commute to downtown Chicago, “thao” complaining about the time-zone differences in her online Vietnamese class, and “josh” complaining about his usual bs. Thao’s class ends in late-August, and she falls back into her old habits of sleeping until 3pm, effectively disappearing forever into perpetuity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, “ugh my internet” escalates into something <i>else</i>. A combination of boredom, delusion, and gossip make for a bustling forum—but only on weekdays. Come Saturday, the chat is deserted. Winter break is similarly represented as a sharp drop in messages, but “ugh my internet” comes back in full force to ring in the new year.
        </p> 
        <p>
          At this point, Thao is like that neighbor who has a copy of your keys and just <i>shows up</i> every once in a while.

          A group chat isn’t <i>really</i> a group chat without its own inside jokes, .GIFs, or whatevers. Sadly, Facebook’s data thing doesn’t save non-text messages (this would be really useful, just saying, <i>Zuck</i>)—but we <i>can</i> try finding some unique phrases or general nonsense.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram'>Bigrams</a> are pairs of (in this case) words that appear next to each other often. Well, they don’t have to occur <i>often</i>, as long as they’re together when they do. So think “Hong Kong,” “okie dokie,” but not “coffee cup,” because both “coffee” and “cup” are fairly common on their own. Identifying bigrams in the group chat corpus is is one way to more-or-less isolate esoteric phrases from common conversation.
